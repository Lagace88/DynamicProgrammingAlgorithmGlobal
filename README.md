# DynamicProgrammingAlgorithmGlobal
School Project

This was a school project that was completed for the class Introduction to Bioinformatics.
It uses the Needleman and Wunsch Dyanmic Programming method to find the optimal alignment of two protien sequences.
It then displays the optimal score and the optimal alignment.

The sequences can be pulled from one file, two files, or they can be entered manually.
It is limited to sequences of 150 chars as that was the criteria for the project.
